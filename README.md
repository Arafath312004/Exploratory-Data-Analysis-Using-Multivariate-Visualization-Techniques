# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Using-Multivariate-Visualization-Techniques
This analysis explores a dataset of 1,715 mobile phone models, detailing features such as price, storage, RAM, pixel density, and year of release. The study employs exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, including scatter plots, trellis plots, and heatmaps, to uncover patterns and relationships.

Scatter plots reveal how price correlates with storage and pixel density, indicating that larger storage capacities significantly influence pricing, while pixel density shows no direct pricing trend. Trellis plots highlight year-over-year trends, showcasing an industry shift toward larger storage options and improved display quality, with high-PPI devices becoming accessible across price ranges.

A heatmap of numeric features illustrates key correlations, such as strong positive relationships between price, storage, and RAM, while identifying trade-offs like the negative correlation between foldable displays and pixel density. The analysis underscores evolving consumer preferences and technological advancements, emphasizing the interplay between design, functionality, and pricing in the mobile phone industry.
